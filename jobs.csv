Experience in modeling and analyzing complex systems, such as two-sided marketplaces, economic platforms, or supply/demand dynamics.
A strong background in building measurement systems and analytical frameworks, particularly using experimental design and advanced causal inference methods.
Experience with or interest in working with human behavioral data, annotation/labeling systems, or projects involving human feedback for AI development and evaluation.
Solid software engineering fundamentals with expertise in Python/R, SQL, AI/ML frameworks, and the modern data science stack.
A toolkit spanning from classical statistical and econometric methods to state-of-the-art ML techniques (especially in forecasting and simulation), with knowledge of how to choose and apply the right tool for each unique problem.
Proven ability to effectively communicate with and influence stakeholders across the organization, from engineers to executives.
Ability to thrive in fast-paced environments and balance speed with quality.
